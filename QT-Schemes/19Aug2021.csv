although Hugh Osmond put his point forcefully, John Bercow thinks it should be emphasised that, really, Hugh Osmond and his colleague lost the case essentially on a technicality about the unavailability of sufficient time to determine the matter before the 17 May. it was very disappointing that on the day when we received the High Court decision that the case was academic because there wasn't time to hear it before 17 May.;Default Inference
none of the facts that Robert Jenrick adduced about government support programmes is going at this moment to be disputed by John Bercow. we have done as much as any country in the world. ;Default Inference

contrary to what was said earlier, we do have access for the data. what we can actually see is that in all respects the data has consistently, from the end of January, been better than those models. Hugh Osmond is afraid the reason to stick to the dates that we've talked about and why that doesn't conflict with the data not dates point, is that it takes five weeks to gather the correct data is incorrect. ;Best Explanation
when solving a problem means a betrayal of the British fishing industry and its decimation on the one hand. in a sense of backhanded compliment to Robert Genrick, whom I served with in the House, it is remarkable through the deployment of his mellifluous tones he can talk about solving a problem. ;Default Inference

the report from SAGE does not give definitive notification on where, when and how transmission considered. what SAGE are saying is the system is not detailed enough for them to be able to say with any high degree of certainty exactly where people are contracting COVID. ;Expert Opinion
what SAGE are saying is the system is not detailed enough for them to be able to say with any high degree of certainty exactly where people are contracting COVID. SAGE's system not being able to be certain about where people contract COVID goes for hospitality as well as anywhere else. ;Default Inference

it is better if we had been driven by data. being driven by data would have helped the hospitality industry. ;Default Inference
we want to choreograph decent, constructive, convivial relations with the European Union for the future. we don't make process by picking juvenile fights not just with one country but with the entirety of the European Union. let's start as we mean to go on, other than adopting gunboat diplomacy then getting some dovish spokesman to appear saying we know we deployed the boats but we mean well after all. ;Threat
we've already had to bring the dogs out to face each other off. we do need to learn to talk. ;Waste
we've already had to bring the dogs out to face each other off. it is a terrible tragedy that we're not getting on well at all with our next door neighbours. ;Default Inference

in December 2019 people said they wanted to get Brexit done. and the government has delivered on the first phase of Brexit.;Default Inference
in a sense it would be counterintuitive if voters said we know we wanted that in significant numbers. but actually we're going to punish the government that delivered what we said we wanted them to deliver. ;Inconsistent Commitment
everyone may not be familiar with the court case Hugh Osmond was involved in. Hugh Osmond should remind everybody what it is you were trying to do in the court case. ;Practical Reasoning

the way to work it through the disagreement between France and Jersey is diplomacy. the French foreign minister was in Jersey yesterday. Robert Jenrick should have had a conversation with the French foreign minister. ;Practical Reasoning
the government is focused on the vaccine programme, recovery post-pandemic, sustaining people's jobs. let's hold an inquiry once we are through this pandemic. ;Consequences
what else could we ask for if we went to this government and said: We're not having it. the European super league died a death as far as Deborah Frances-White can make out on Twitter because the people didn't want it. ;Default Inference
Ian Wright, Gary Neville and the rest led, the fans have put a terrific protest and this time this protest must persist until it prevails. John Bercow hugely admires Ian Wright, Gary Neville and the rest. ;Default Inference
the government can pass laws. the government can regulate the game more. there's a lot of things the government can do. ;Sign
Robert Jenrick hopes we can use this as an opportunity to make the game more dynamic, more democratic and more in the interests of the fan. Robert Jenrick is pleased that we killed that proposal. ;Consequences

Thangham Debbonaire knows we want to rebuild our economy. Thangam Debbonaire has ideas about how we can do that. ;Default Inference
none more so than the vaccine programme. you're going to see some of the benefits of Brexit. ;Consequences
that's the point that the minister, Chris Witty, our experts, review the data in the knowledge of all the facts, make a decision, then provide sufficient time for the sector to provide for whatever the outcome is. it is better not to rush and make a decision before you're armed with all the information. ;Consequences
we're not children. the public of both countries would like both leaders to be grown up. ;Default Inference
then you have time to make the public and businesses like Hugh's. you ensure there is a five-week wait which gives enough time to have the information on which to make an informed decision. you gather the data. it is right to stick to what we created. ;Practical Reasoning
in about 10 days' time people will be able to go to indoor concerts, up to 100 people. maybe four adults cannot have a meal indoors and have a glass of wine with their meal. AudienceMember 20210819QT18 finds Scottish rules on serving food and booze is ridiculous.;Default Inference

Deborah Frances-White is getting her information from this government and they are the absolute worse. Deborah Frances-White doesn't know if hospitality should open now. ;Direct Ad Hominem
the French were talking about cutting power to Jersey off. the French are not very proportionate either. ;Direct Ad Hominem
the French blockading a British port is a disgusting thing to have done. the French were not being diplomatic. ;Direct Ad Hominem
Labour have opposed the government on school exam results or free school meals in the holiday. Labour have stood up in support of people with low income, those in the private rented sector where Thangam Debbonaire has called for the eviction ban. Keir Starmer has opposed the government many, many times. ;Inconsistent Commitment
clearly the French behaved badly. the French were talking about cutting power to Jersey off. ;Direct Ad Hominem
no. Deborah Frances-White feels really disappointed that Keir Starmer's first response to the Policing Bill was to abstain. ;Default Inference
we have seen that schoolchildren, students, young people have been hammered by school closures, university closures and so forth. Labour Party certainly doesn't seem to stand for standing up for the young, hard-working people who have been most affected by lockdown and the underprivileged voter base. ;Inconsistent Commitment
the data and science have at no point supported the government on deciding not to allow the hospitality to reopen. not allowing the hospitality to reopen is a disgrace. ;Inconsistent Commitment

the problem with Stan Chronicy, is that he doesn't know one end of a football pitch from the other. John Bercow's particular bug bear is if you are going to have billionaires involved then it would be a good start if those people cared a flying flamingos goal about the sport of football. ;Direct Ad Hominem

Sir Keir Starmer brushes his hair before he does speeches. Sir Keir Starmer seems like a grownup. ;Best Explanation
when Robert Jenrick says he's glad the dispute between the British and the French has been put to bed, fish exports from the UK being down 31% is hardly a result. Robert Jenrick can't be happy with UK fish export being down 31%.;Inconsistent Commitment

if they are unhappy about anything they do a blockade for everything. it is just typical French. ;Direct Ad Hominem
the French ships have moved away. the Royal Navy is able to move away as well. ;Cause To Effect
the one thing for the French fishermen is people are at least now paying   attention to them. Scottish fishermen feel so betrayed by the Brexit deal. they might be wondering if they should be taking a leaf out of the French fisher folks' book. ;Cause To Effect
there is nothing that the UK Government can see that indicates that there is going to be a delay. it is literally a question now of 10 days until most of the aspects of the UK economy will be able to reopen. it would be doing the country a disservice at this stage to rush rather than waiting a little bit longer.;Waste
Brexit was put to bed. Brexit's got up again. ;Default Inference

strong opposition is good for democracy. in a democracy every government needs a strong opposition. ;Default Inference

sending the royal navy to a minor fishing dispute was an absurd act. no. ;Default Inference
the French fishermen in Jersey aren't new-comers. the French fishermen should have had their paperwork in in time. ;Precedent
Labour stood up for people on school meals. Labour stood up and got a reversal of a decision by the government. Labour stood up for people on the evictions ban. Labour stood up for people on cladding which is so important to so many people across the country. Labour have stood up for people. ;Analogy
in this case, as explained by Hugh Osmond, the reality is that we have been driven or at least the government has doggedly and dogmatically been driven by dates, irrespective of the emerging data. the adage we should be driven by data not dates has been turned on its head. ;Default Inference
the government were right. it is not a dip the French were in the country yesterday. ;Best Explanation
clearly the French behaved badly. whether our response was proportionate, it is difficult to say. who was to blame for sending ships where, it is very difficult to say. ;Ignorance
they have had 900 deaths in Australia. Australia has a population of 26 million. commensurately, we could have had, say, 3,000 deaths here. Maybe, okay, we are densely populated so maybe 6,000.;Default Inference
we can see that the effectiveness of preventing effectiveness in severe disease was better than assumed. the number of hospital admissions has fallen. we had enough data a month ago to see the assumptions behind the models were wrong from the start, from the outset were based on bad data. ;Best Explanation
football is part of our heritage, our culture, whether that's the biggest or smallest clubs. we need now a shift in the fundamental power dynamic in the game away from big billionaires back to the fans. ;Best Explanation

fans got something shifted. there is a sense of power, power to the people. ;Best Explanation
the Scottish fisherman's federation says it is desperately poor. Scottish fishermen feel so betrayed by the Brexit deal. ;Best Explanation
it is a minor but significant scandal that the SAGE report was leaked out at the last minute after the conclusion of the case. on the very same day after the court made its decision and it came out afterwards, there was published quietly by the government a full report from SAGE based on UK information throughout the epidemic that said it found no evidence that pubs and restaurants or hospitality in general were prone to infection. ;Best Explanation
it is very different from 1979 or even 2010 when people wanted government out of the way. there is a market for a left-of-centre party that can show how it will tackle the levelling up agenda, how it will help the left-behind, the left-out, the left-to-rot.;Best Explanation
people want a protective state and a Labour Party. it is very different from 1979 or even 2010 when people wanted government out of the way.;Inconsistent Commitment

the distribution of the vaccine is overwhelmingly about the NHS. the devising of the vaccine is overwhelmingly about the quality of scientists. development and distribution of the vaccine has little to do with the government. ;Best Explanation
consistent with the fact of suspension of normal politics, there is a wave of relief in the country at the arrival and, yes, the effective distribution of the vaccine. there is a desire to reward the government. ;Best Explanation

it is not cutting through to Hugh Osmond. you can list these things but to some people that is not coming across. ;Default Inference
it's difficult to judge anyone at this time of going through the pandemic and coming out of it. we underestimate how difficult it has to be for any opposition leader to get themselves heard while we're going through the pandemic and coming out of it. you have to give Keir Starmer a couple of years. ;Best Explanation
it is only 17 months ago that the red wall seats revoted against Labour and turned to the Conservatives. Labour losing Hartlepool isn't really a shock to John Bercow.;Best Explanation
what is at stake is an argument about the behaviour of the Jersey authorities and, more particularly, the British government, in surreptitiously introducing new regulatory burdens and compliance requirements with minimal notice, of which the French fishermen couldn't have been aware. it isn't a question of people not filling in forms that they knew they had to complete. ;Cause To Effect
businesses are closing all over the place. the hospitality industry is literally on its knees. ;Cause To Effect
