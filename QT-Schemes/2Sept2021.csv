a generation of young Afghans are watching the future unravel in front of their eyes. millions of young Afghans grew up with a transformation - girls, who never would have had chances before. we owe it to the generation of young Afghans not to engage in a counsel of despair, but to think what can we do right now to assert leverage over the situation and protect those gains. ;Waste
those failures were political and strategic. the failures were not the failures and mistakes of the very many people led by Afghans themselves, with British troops supporting them. ;Best Explanation

up to 5,000 people, when we already know that the scale of this crisis is going to be way beyond that. one reason that the government are on the right track is that it is absolutely clear that 5,000 is too small a number over the next 12 months and we've got to make a more generous offer than that.;Threat

British people lost their lives, as well as the Americans. Al-Qaeda was being harboured in Afghanistan. the attacks on the world trade centres were devastating. ;Best Explanation
Al-Qaeda was being harboured in Afghanistan. the initial entry was to prevent Al-Qaeda from using Afghanistan as a base of operations. ;Sign

AudienceMember 20210902QT25 saw some numbers earlier today been that's one in every four villages. the idea that 5,000 a year, even if you take all of them, and they come tomorrow, 20,000 turned up tomorrow is a joke.;Default Inference
one person in every four villages and towns in the UK. clearly, we can take more refugees. ;Best Explanation
at the most simple analysis of the situation, we are a major player in the last 20 years of this situation. the numbers of refugees are a joke.;Best Explanation

we need to implement democracy.. the reason of why have we failed on the exit strategy is to implement democracy, and that has proven to be a much harder proposition. ;Default Inference
we have seen the demand for the democracy from a quarter of the members of the jirga, the Afghan parliament, women. we then chose collectively also to seek to bring about a positive change in Afghanistan, support women's emancipation, education. ;Consequences
there was no exit strategy that had any mindful bearing on what the Afghan people actually wanted or needed. the problem is, when we talk about Afghanistan, to Afghans, we talk at Afghans. ;Default Inference
it was a consequence by a decision of the United States to withdraw. the exit from Afghanistan was an American unilateral decision. ;Default Inference
there was an agreement that the US would be leaving and Joe Biden has always made clear that he would respect that agreement. the American administration obviously felt they wanted to leave within a particular time frame. ;Default Inference
the government appears to have been relying on intelligence up to now that said that the Taliban were unlikely to advance. can't we all just agree that we totally did or did not underestimate the Taliban forces in the first place. ;Best Explanation

it is in the government's gift how they control what questions are granted. questions the Foreign Secretary was dragged to the House of Commons to answer have never been granted. ;Default Inference
you might not agree with what Rory Stewart says. troops should stay. ;Default Inference
the government appears to have been relying on intelligence up to now that said that the Taliban were unlikely to advance. the first is about intelligence. ;Default Inference
the intelligence we had about the capabilities of both the government and the taliban clearly was completely and utterly wrong. the first is about intelligence. ;Default Inference
we don't have any understanding as far as Lisa Nandy can work out about what is happening on the ground. we need to get a line of sight on what is happening beyond Kabul. ;Expert Opinion

terrorism goes on all around the world. you cannot defeat an ideology from dropping bombs from 30,000 feet.;Default Inference
Mehdi Hasan definitely hasn't been in favour of the war over the last 20 years. Mehdi Hasan is probably the wrong person to ask what the war was for.;Best Explanation

it turned out that Dominic Raab was on holiday as the Taliban advanced. don't make the mistake of thinking just because some of us recognise this is a complex and difficult situation that all of us need to own up to some level of responsibility. ;Default Inference
one of the reasons why we have put Foreign Office, Home Office, and Ministry of Defence staff forward into Kabul is to make sure that people who would wish to do us harm are not using the current circumstance to insert themselves into the UK. James Cleverly doesn't know the circumstances around the reasons why some Afghan might have been refused asylum to the UK. ;Default Inference
withdrawing the forces from the Afghanistan is an immense victory for Jihadists, coming before the anniversary of 9/11. we're less secure.;Best Explanation
security ought to be a priority. Lisa Nandy was surprised today in the House of Commons, when the Prime Minister made quite a lengthy statement to the House about our strategy, that this only warranted two sentences in his reply. ;Default Inference

there have been a series of political and strategic failures over a very long period of time that led to here. the current situation has long and deep roots. ;Best Explanation
after the 9/11 attacks, for the UK to want to respect that Article 5 of the NATO Agreement had been invoked, that we have a duty to come to the mutual aid of NATO member states that British citizens have been some of the second biggest victims of the 9/11 attacks outside of the United States. first to acknowledge that the entry strategy was flawed as well.;Default Inference

the UK Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister felt it was okay to go on holiday during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. the UK Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister were not prepared for the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. ;Best Explanation
the UK Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister were not prepared for the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. the UK Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister should hang their heads in shame. ;Default Inference
the United Kingdom played a massive part in getting itself involved in Afghanistan. for us to be talking about allowing only 5,000 people from Afghanistan a year is quite frankly disgusting. we should say our arms are open to whoever from Afghanistan wants to come.;Sunk Costs

more than 40 countries were involved in the Afghan war. If we share the burden, we can help the people in need from the Afghan war.;Default Inference
countries coming together to share the burden was done for the South Vietnamese boat people. countries coming together to share the burden can be done for Afghanistan. ;Analogy
